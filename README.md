shFlags README
==============

shFlags is a port of the Google [gflags](http://gflags.github.io/gflags/)
library for Unix shell. The code is written in a way to be as portable as
possible to work across a wide array of Unix variants. It is also tested with
[shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) to maintain code quality.

If you'd like to use shFlags, feel free to read the documentation.
